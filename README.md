# SafeVision
Safevision is an AI-based solution designed to enhance public health governance by automatically detecting and counting individuals wearing face masks in real-time video feeds. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning (using a fine-tuned VGG16 model) to monitor mask compliance in public spaces, providing valuable insights.
